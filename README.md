# Experience

Building this was fun!
I'm not sure if state management is required, but based off of our discusssion yesterday, I decided to make use of it to show a bit of skills in that domain. Alongside add other functionalites such as `Order by Alphabets(Asc and Desc)` and `Pagination`, all requirements have been correctly worked on.

## What would you have done better?

- Optimizing page performance more.
- Enhance the style of the list and list items, add `Sort and Search` optimizations.

## Challenges faced

Encountered some challenges with `Redux store configuration`. **Time** factor plus other personal emergency didn't give me the freedom to be fine-tune every issue to my taste.

## Note

Note that every user without an id will not appear in the list when performing any user action such as **sorting, searching, filtering.**
